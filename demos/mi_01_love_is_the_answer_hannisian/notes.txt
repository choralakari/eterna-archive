Love is the Answer
Raymond Hannisian
Still looking for a biography of that composer

Morning comes, and I must go; day is breaking yonder.
After all the places I have been, now I'm going home.
I have been to seek the sky, to travel on the highway.
And the time has come, I don't know why, I'm going home.

Ref:
Where is the answer to so many questions?
I don't know, so I begin another journey.
Where is the meaning for my world? I see the answer now.

Though we came by different roads, now we walk together.
Stay beside me all our days, strangers never more.
Through the cool of summer rains, by the heart-side fire,
I'll be with you when nothing remains, I am home to stay.

Ref2:
Love is the answer to so many questions.
Now I know, and I can stop my endless wand'ring.
Love gives meaning to my world,
I see the answer now.
Love is the answer. Love.
