This traditional tune was last sung in 2018 at Sto. Niño Parish, Getafe, Bohol.

---
Lord, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Lord, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
Where there is hatred, let me bring love;
Where there is injury, let me bring pardon;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there's despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, let me bring light;
Where there is sadness, let me bring joy;
Where there is sadness, let me bring joy.
