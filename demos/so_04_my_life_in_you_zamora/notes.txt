Where can I run and hide from
you or could I ever do
When everywhere I know you're there, anywhere you'll find me

Where could I go to flee from you or could I ever do
When your hands keep holding me, guiding me, around me

God, I know that you are there
You know who I am and all I do
God, you see me through and through Take my hand, I trust in you
I put my life in you

You know me when I sit or stand, my life is in your hand
You read my thoughts from far away, in everything you know me

You know me in my darkest hour
You give me strength and power
You are there beside me, watching me for always

God, I know that you are there
You know who I am and all I do
God, you see me through and through Take my hand, I trust in you
I put my life in you

For all the wonders that you gave me, for all the marvels that you do,
for all of this, I like to thank you and praise you

God, I know that you are there
You know who I am and all I do
God, you see me through and through Take my hand, I trust in you
I put my life in you

I put my life in you
