When a piece of music is too intricate to adapt for a custom four-part choir, its arrangement will appear here in a format for solo voice and chamber pipe organ.  
Similar to the Choral Akari Archive, which gathers my choral arrangements, this sub-project mainly features Christian music.  
All of my voice and organ arrangements are found [here in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nESecS1zvlXZ4XFU2lk9q0EWXgwYFf1v).
