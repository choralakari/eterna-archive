Voi Che Sapete (Tell Me What Love Is)
Charlotte Church

Tell me what love is, what can it be
What is this yearning burning in me?
Can I survive it, will I endure?
This is my sickness, is there a cure?
First his obsession seizing my brain
Starting in passion, ending in pain
I start to shiver, then I'm on fire
Then I'm a quiver with seething desire
Who knows the secret, who holds the key?
I long for something - what can it be?
My brain is reeling, I wonder why;
And then the feeling I'm going to die
By day it haunts me, haunts me by night
This tender torment, tinged with delight!
Tell me what love is, what can it be?
What is this yearning, burning in me?
What is this yearning, burning in me?
What is this yearning, burning in me?
