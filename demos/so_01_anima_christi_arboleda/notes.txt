Based on a popular prayer since attributed to St. Ignatius of Loyola, it is a popular Catholic liturgical song played during the Mass communion.

Jandi Arboleda, the composer of the musical arrangement, had first memorized it as a prayer for his First Communion as an elementary school student at the Jesuit-run Ateneo Grade School, but inadvertently missed the line “Blood of Christ, inebriate me” as he studied it.

Despite the missing line, the Ignatian prayer has been sung with this arrangement ever since.

[Verse 1]
Soul of Christ, sanctify me
Body of Christ, save me
Water from the side of Christ, wash me
Passion of Christ, give me strength

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear me Jesus, hide me in Thy wounds
That I may never leave Thy side

[Chorus]
From all the evil that surrounds me, defend me
And when the call of death arrives, bid me come to Thee
That I may praise Thee with Thy saints forever
